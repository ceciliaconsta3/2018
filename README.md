# 2018
A year in review

## :round_pushpin: Goals
Last year, I completed my first round of [#100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/ceciliaconsta3/My-100-Days-of-Code) to start forming the habit while beginning my first development related job. Besides this p1xt-inspired guide, I'll do my best to beat or at least match the 29 credit streak I accomplished last term, as well as help any of the local business who approach me for freelance opportunities.

Aside from programming, some of my other goals include reading more(ease in book a month), learning more Korean (work through a learning resource), and getting in better shape (let's set the stakes at 150min of moderate activity a week).

Depending on time constraints and unforeseen circumstances, I may add some content or remove items that have been made redundant or irrelevant so that at the end of the year an accurate self-audit can be made. Anything I don't complete this year and is still viable will be added to next year's list.
