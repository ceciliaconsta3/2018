# 2018
A technical year in review

## Goals

Last year, I completed my first round of [#100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/ceciliaconsta3/My-100-Days-of-Code) to start forming the habit while beginning my first development related job. Besides this pixie-inspired guide, I'll do my best to beat or at least match the 29 credit streak I accomplished last term, as well as help any of the local business who approach me for freelance opportunities.

Aside from programming, some of my other goals include reading more(ease in book a month), learning more Korean (work through a learning resource), and getting in better shape (let's set the stakes at 150min of moderate activity a week).

Depending on time constraints and unforeseen circumstances, I may add some content which will be distinguished from the original content, but nothing will be removed so that at the end of the year a fair comparison can be made.
